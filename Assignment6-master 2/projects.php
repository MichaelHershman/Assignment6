        <h3> Combat Robotics </h3>

            <p>Combat Robotics is a team under UR Robotics that builds 1-30lb combat robots for various competitions. No prior experience required, but enthusiasm wanted. This is primarily an electro-mechanical project with a heavy emphasis on mechanical fabrication, but there are a lot of areas to explore within like 3D modeling and simulation, project engineering, solid mechanics, electrical design and assembly, and 3D printing. We are looking to take on people's ideas for building some smaller robots this year. If you have any questions, please email our team leader Daniel. </p>


        <h3> Drone Project </h3>
            <img src="images/drone.jpg" class="rounded" alt="">
            <p>The aim of this project is to create a solar-enabled drone that can autonomously hover in the air and avoid obstacles with the main aim of continuously renewing its battery power while still in flight. The problem we are tackling is the short battery life witnessed in drones today, typically no more than 30 minutes of flight in commercial drones. Our student team will collaboratively work together with faculty to achieve the goal of extending the battery life of the drone. We need skills in: algorithmic implementation, computer vision, Arduino/Raspberry Pi, product design, mechanical engineering, electrical & computer programming, renewable energy, and all interested students from all majors. All ideas are welcome as we shall build this drone together as a team.</p>

    <h3> UR Hand Project </h3>

            <img src="images/hand.jpg" class="rounded" alt="">

        <p>The goal of this project is to create a hand-like robot that can be controlled by a glove on a user. The user would perform an action with the glove on, and the robot will mimic the motions. This could be an interesting project mechanically (as our team could attempt to improve current designs of prosthetic and robotic hands) and electronically (the team could experiment with various sensors to detect movement).</p>


    <h3> MATE Team </h3>

            <img src="images/marine.jpg" class="rounded" alt="">


        <p>UR MATE is a team under UR Robotics aiming to implement a submarine to compete within the MATE underwater International Competition. No prior experience is needed. There are a lot of different areas to explore within MATE, including coding, electrical and mechanical engineering, 3D modeling, presentation skills and much more! If you have any questions or would be interested in hearing more about UR MATE, donâ€™t hesitate to contact Adham.</p>
